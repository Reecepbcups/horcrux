- In cryptography, a **nonce** (number once) is an arbitrary number that can be used just once in a cryptographic communication.

- A cryptographic key is called **ephemeral** if it is generated for each execution of a key establishment process. 

- **Threshold signatures** allow for splitting a private key into m secret shares. To sign a message, at least some threshold of the shareholders need to coordinate and provide their individual signatures using their share. These individual signatures combine to form a single valid signature.
